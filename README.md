## How to run
First of all you need to generate the prisma client folder. On the root of the project run the following command:
```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

After this step you can now run both the web-app and the API by running the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The web application are gonna be executed at `http://localhost:3000` and the api at `http://localhost:3001/api`

Enjoy!
